# room-checker

If you work in a hotel often you dont know which rooms are already cleaned.

To solve this issue I had the idea to create this app so the cleaning crew can note down which rooms are finished and in which rooms they are currently working.

This way the reception has a quick and easy way to check what rooms they already can rent.
